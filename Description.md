### General Information


- **Auto-Crawl Data on Website 24hmoney.ipynb:** Perhaps this is one of the most time-consuming scripts I wrote during my internship because this is a dynamic website that uses JavaScript to hide changes in URLs. It required me to dive deep into understanding its functionality as well as its HTML structures

- **Auto-Download File pdf on VietStock.ipynb:** Additionally, this is the second script I have worked with for another dynamic website, and the main purpose of this script is to automatically download PDF files.

- **Auto-Rename File.ipynb:** Because not only the finance and banking sectors but also other industries have their own file naming conventions that vary each year, leading to inconsistencies in managing and retrieving them, I wrote this script to rename all of them to a common format for various cases.
  
- **Fill Each File Into The Correct Folder.ipynb :** Finally, since the company is in the process of building a data warehouse, my boss requires our team to collect a large amount of data along with separate folders for easier management and to minimize errors while still ensuring work progress. Therefore, instead of doing it manually, I wrote this script to organize the crawled data files in PDF and Excel formats into their respective directories.
